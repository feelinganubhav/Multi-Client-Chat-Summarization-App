# Multi-Client-Chat-Summarization-App
It is a chat application capable of accommodating multiple clients simultaneously. 
The application comprises a server component responsible for managing the communication 
among clients and summarizing the discussions after each chat session.

Key Requirements:
Chat Application: Developing a user-friendly chat interface allowing multiple clients to 
exchange messages in real time. The interface supports basic features such as 
sending/receiving messages, creating chat room, and managing user connections.
 
Server Module: Implementing a robust server module to facilitate communication between 
clients. The server is capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently and 
managing the flow of messages between them. Additionally, the server will maintain chat 
room information and user statuses.
 
Summarization Feature: Designing a functionality within the server to summarize the 
discussions that occur during each chat session. The summarization process analyzes the 
exchanged messages and generates a concise overview or recap of the key points discussed.
 By addressing these requirements, the goal is to develop a robust and feature-rich chat 
application that enables seamless communication among multiple clients while providing a 
summarization feature to capture the essence of the discussions held during each chat 
session
